use super::Sorter;

/// Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm and should be avoided in the case of large collections.
/// It will not be efficient in the case of a reverse-ordered collection.
///
/// ## How it works
///
/// Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that
/// repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are
/// in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
/// The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger
/// elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
///
/// ## Performance `O(n^2)`
///
/// Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of `Ðž(n2)`,
/// where `n` is the number of items being sorted.
///
/// Worst-case:    `O(n^2)`
///
/// Average-case:  `O(n^2)`
///
/// Best-Case:     `O(n)` -- when the list is already sorted.
